A simple template for getting started with [Material Web Component](https://github.com/material-components/material-web) using TypeScript.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build` to build the project. This in turn runs `npx rollup -c`.
4. Serve it using any web server of your choice (I serve it with IIS Express for VS Code).
